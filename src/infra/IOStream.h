/// \brief Defines IO Stream class and methods
///
/// This header defines classes and methods for IO Streams. IOStreams define
/// reading and writing of fields from/to a data file. Each stream contains
/// information on the file location, the frequency of input/output, the
/// fields to be read/written and other information necessary for file I/O.
/// Note that this is different from the C++ stdlib iostreams
/// Streams are added to the input configuration file as shown in this example
/// \ConfigInput
/// # IO Streams (examples for Default config)
/// IOStreams:
///    # InitialState should only be used when starting from scratch.
///    # For restart runs, the frequency units should be changed from
///    # "OnStartup" to "never" so that the initial state file is not read.
///    InitialState:
///      UsePointerFile: false
///      Filename: OmegaMesh.nc
