## Dimension

When performing IO, some metadata associated with each dimension in Omega
must be defined. We provide a Dimension class to hold this metadata for use by
the IO and Streams classes. This metadata is defined internally in Omega and
there are no user-configurable options. More detail is proved in
{ref}`omega-dev-dimension`.
