# The Ocean Model for E3SM Global Applications (OMEGA)

OMEGA is the ocean component planned for v4 of the
Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM). It is
based on the earlier Model for Prediction Across
Scales (MPAS) - Ocean model, but has been completely
redesigned and rewritten for better computational
performance and portability. 

The OMEGA code will be primarily updated in the [E3SM Repository](https://github.com/E3SM-Project/E3SM).  Changes will be mirrored here.
